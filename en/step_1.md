## Introduction

Create an outdoor physical computing tag game with RFID readers.

This resource is a simplified version of an [original idea](https://youtu.be/CM7YRi4nfeQ){:target="_blank"} by winning Pioneers team Robot Apocalypse Committee for the **Make it outdoors** theme. You can see their original [PiTag code](https://github.com/RobotApocalypseCommittee/PiTag){:target="_blank"} and [PiTag server code](https://github.com/RobotApocalypseCommittee/PiTagServer){:target="_blank"} on GitHub.

### What you will make

Each player will wear a shirt containing the Raspberry Pi, RFID reader and LED, and will wear a glove with an attached RFID tag.

[Add a picture here]

When a player is tagged, their LED will change colour to show they have been caught.

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

+ [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/physical-computing/builder/){:target="_blank"}

+ [Apply basic programming constructs to solve a problem](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/programming/builder/){:target="_blank"}
