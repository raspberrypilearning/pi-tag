## Challenge: more games

At the moment you can play a tag game with two or more players, where one player tries to tag the other. If there are multiple players, the objective becomes to try to turn all players to your team's colour.

+ Can you think of any other games you could play? How would you need to alter the code to be able to play these games?

+ The **Robot Apocalypse Committee** Pioneers team created a game server to record who tagged who. Could you extend your project to add a server?

You can see the original [PiTag code](https://github.com/RobotApocalypseCommittee/PiTag){:target="_blank"} and [PiTag server code](https://github.com/RobotApocalypseCommittee/PiTagServer){:target="_blank"} on GitHub, although the original game was created for Arduino.
