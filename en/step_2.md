## What you will need

### Hardware

You will need one set of hardware per player, so for example if you have two tag players you will need to double the kit quantities on this list.

We used the [MonkMakes clever card kit](https://www.monkmakes.com/cck/) which contains all of the following components:

+ RFID tag reader
+ RFID tag or card
+ 7 female-female jumper leads
+ RGB LED with pre-attached jumper leads

Plus:

+ Raspberry Pi Zero with header
+ USB battery pack

### Software

+ Python 3
+ SPI-Py and SimpleMFRC522 (installation instructions come with the RFID kit)

### Additional Resources

+ Old t-shirt or sports bib
+ Needle and thread
+ Glove
