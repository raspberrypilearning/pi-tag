## What you will need

### Hardware

You will need one set of hardware per player, so for example if you have two tag players you will need to double the kit quantities on this list.

We used the [MonkMakes clever card kit](https://www.monkmakes.com/cck/){:target="_blank"} which contains all of the following components:

+ RFID tag reader
+ RFID tag or card
+ 7 female-female jumper leads
+ RGB LED with pre-attached jumper leads

Plus:

+ Raspberry Pi Zero or Zero-W
+ Male header and soldering iron to attach it OR [hammer header](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/gpio-hammer-header){:target="_blank"}
+ USB battery pack

### Software

+ Python 3 (comes as standard with Raspbian)
+ SPI-Py
+ MFRC522 and SimpleMFRC522

Your Raspberry Pi will reboot after the final command.
