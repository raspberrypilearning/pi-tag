## Challenge: no cheating

At the moment, the LED starts off as white to let you know the reader is ready to start the game. However, after a while the LED should display the player's colour.

+ Can you write some code to wait a few seconds and then switch the LED to the player's colour? You will need to store the colour the player who owns this RFID reader has in your script.

At the moment, if a player is tagged by another player, they can just change back to their own colour by touching their own RFID reader with their card.

+ Can you write some code to prevent this from happening?
